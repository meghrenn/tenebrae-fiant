        <p>Looks like you can take a hint and follow a clue. Good to know. Now for the next step:</p>
        <p> In the foyer of the LINC building there’s a statue of a pronghorn.</p>
        <p>(Some people say its name is Kevin.)</p>
        <p>
            Legend is that you can rub the snout/antlers for good luck in exams and pat the rear for good luck in
            upcoming games. I recommend you do either—neither is quite a match for our situation, but if this plot goes
            as deep as I think it does, you’ll need all the luck you can get.</p>
        <p> Take a photo of yourself performing this ritual then submit the file to me. That way I know you’re
            committed. We can move forward from there.

            <h2>What This Is</h2>
            <p>You may be confused. You may be wondering what you have stumbled upon. You may have questions. What
                is
                this
                thing, anyway?</p>
            <p>Reality is subjective. For me, this is my cry into the void, my hoping for an echo. These are my
                memories
                and my
                nightmares. This is my attempt against entropy and the forces that seek to destroy this institution.
            </p>
            <p>For you, this is a game, a quest, a puzzle. An opportunity to learn, perhaps? A chance to save the
                school.</p>
            <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
            <p>I have developed this interface as a secure way to pass clues and messages onto you with minimal
                antagonistic
                interference. You will have to work through a number of tasks and problems to reach the goal. If you
                become
                stuck, let me know, and I may be able to help further; however, you will also need to seek help from
                other
                sources. Consider the entities around you who may be of use.

                <li>Things May Go Wrong. If this happens, alert me to it, and I will see what strings I can pull to
                    make
                    them
                    right again.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>Who am I? Good question--one I often ask, myself. Like all entities, I am not so much an object as I
                am a process; I am built up and down; I am compacted, quickly. I am not myself for very long before
                I am
                something new. I am prone to digression, in my words and in my being.</p>
            <p>For this moment, I am a guide. I cannot solve the problems for you but I can help you navigate
                them. ontinue the game and I can tell you more.</p>
